```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(stplanr)
```

**stplanr** is a package for sustainable transport planning with R.

It provides functions for solving common problems in transport planning and modelling, such as how to best get from point A to point B. The overall aim is to provide a reproducible, transparent and accessible toolkit to help people better understand transport systems and inform policy, as outlined in a [paper](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-053/index.html) about the package, and the potential for open source software in transport planning in general, published in the [R Journal](http://journal.r-project.org/).

The initial work on the project was funded by the Department of Transport
([DfT](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-transport))
as part of the development of the Propensity to Cycle Tool
(PCT), a web application to explore current travel patterns and cycling potential at zone, desire line, route and route network levels (see [www.pct.bike](http://www.pct.bike/) and click on a region to try it out).
The basis of the methods underlying the PCT is origin-destination data, which are used to highlight where many short distance trips are being made, and estimate how many could switch to cycling.
The results help identify where cycleways are most needed, an important component of sustainable transport planning infrastructure engineering and policy [design](https://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/doi/abs/10.1680/dfct.63495.001).
See
the package vignette (e.g. via `vignette("introducing-stplanr")`) 
or an [academic paper on the Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT)](http://dx.doi.org/10.5198/jtlu.2016.862)
for more information on how it can be used.
This README provides some basics.

**stplanr** should be useful to researchers everywhere.
The function `route_graphhopper()`, for example, works anywhere in the world
using the [graphhopper](https://graphhopper.com/) routing API and
`read_table_builder()` reads-in Australian data. We welcome contributions that make
transport research easier worldwide.

## Key functions

Data frames representing flows between origins and destinations
must be combined with geo-referenced zones or points to generate meaningful
analyses and visualisations of 'flows' or origin-destination (OD) data.
**stplanr** facilitates this with
`od2line()`, which takes flow and geographical data as inputs and
outputs spatial data. Some example data is provided in the package:

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
library(stplanr)
```

Let's take a look at this data:

```{r}
flow[1:3, 1:3] # typical form of flow data
cents_sf[1:3,] # points representing origins and destinations
```

These datasets can be combined as follows:

```{r plot1, warning=FALSE}
travel_network <- od2line(flow = flow, zones = cents_sf)
w <- flow$All / max(flow$All) *10
plot(travel_network, lwd = w)
```

The package can also allocate flows to the road network, e.g. with [CycleStreets.net](https://www.cyclestreets.net/api/) and the OpenStreetMap Routing Machine ([OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend)) API interfaces.
These are supported in `route_*()` functions such as `route_cyclestreets` and `route_osrm()`:

Route functions take lat/lon inputs (results not calculated):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
trip <- route_osrm(from = c(-1, 53), to = c(-1.1, 53))
```

and place names, found using the Google Map API:

```{r cycle-trip, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
if(!Sys.getenv("CYCLESTREET") == ""){
  trip <- route_cyclestreet("Bradford, UK", "Leeds, Yorkshire", plan = "balanced")
  plot(trip)
}
```

We can replicate this call multiple times using `line2route`, in this case lines 2 to 5.
First we'll create a small subset of the lines:

```{r}
desire_lines <- travel_network[2:5,]
```


Next, we'll calculate the routes (not not evaluated):

```{r plot2, results='hide', message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
routes <- line2route(desire_lines, route_fun = route_osrm)
```

The resulting routes will look something like this:

```{r}
routes = routes_fast_sf[2:5, ]
plot(routes$geometry)
```


Another way to visualise this is with the leaflet package:

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addPolylines(data = routes)
```

For more examples, `example("line2route")`.

`overline` is a function which takes a series of route-allocated lines,
splits them into unique segments and aggregates
the values of overlapping lines. This can represent where there will be
most traffic on the transport system, as illustrated
below. 

```{r rnet, warning=FALSE}
routes$All <- desire_lines$All
rnet <- overline2(routes, attrib = "All")

lwd <- rnet$All / mean(rnet$All)
plot(rnet, lwd = lwd, reset = FALSE)
plot(cents_sf, add = TRUE)
```

## Installation

To install the stable version, use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("stplanr")
```

The development version can be installed using **devtools**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools") # if not already installed
devtools::install_github("ropensci/stplanr")
library(stplanr)
```

stplanr depends on rgdal, which can be tricky to install.

### Installing stplanr on Linux and Mac

**splanr** depends on **rgdal** which can be installed on Ubuntu, for example, with:

```
sudo apt install r-cran-rgdal
```

To install `gdal` binaries on other distributions please see here: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries

**stplanr** also depends on **sf**. Installation instructions for Mac, Ubuntu and other Linux distros can be found here: https://github.com/r-spatial/sf#installing

Instructions to install `gdal` and `Quartz` are provided at https://github.com/ropensci/geojsonio#install and https://www.xquartz.org/ respectively (Quartz is required for R - as described [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)).

## Funtions, help and contributing

The current list of available functions can be seen with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lsf.str("package:stplanr", all = TRUE)
```

To get internal help on a specific function, use the standard way.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?od2line
```

## Dependencies

**stplanr** imports many great packages that it depends on. Many thanks to the developers of these tools:

```{r}
desc = read.dcf("DESCRIPTION")
headings = dimnames(desc)[[2]]
fields = which(headings %in% c("Depends", "Imports", "Suggests"))
pkgs = paste(desc[fields], collapse = ", ")
pkgs = gsub("\n", " ", pkgs)
strsplit(pkgs, ",")[[1]]
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# Aim: explore dependencies
install.packages("miniCRAN")
library(miniCRAN)
tags <- "stplanr"
pkgDep(tags)
dg <- makeDepGraph(tags, enhances = TRUE)
set.seed(1)
plot(dg, legendPosition = c(-1, 1), vertex.size = 20)
library(DiagrammeR)
DiagrammeR::visnetwork(dg)
visNetwork::visIgraph(dg)
```
